### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned in this challenge was how to change the color of the img provided. After some research, I found that all I had to do was store the image in a container and set a background color. Then adding mix-blend-mode: multiply to the image:

```css
.stats-card__img-container {
  /* change color of containers background */
  background-color: var(--clr-accent);
}
/* mix-blend-mode -- specifies how an elements content should blend with its direct parent background */
.stats-card__img-container img {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

Also, getting the height of the image to fit the container once I switched to the desktop view. Funny enough it was a very easy fix by just setting the height to 100% ðŸ˜†
